<h1>Daily UI</h1>
<p>This is a frontend-developer version of Daily UI.</p>
<p>I will both create my own UI:s or take an existing one from http://collectui.com/designs and create a HTML/CSS/JS version of it</p>
<p>I might not end up creating one each day, but I will try and create each and everyone of them eventually, it just might take some extra days for several.</p>
